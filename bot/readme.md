/src contains all the typescripts source files and where most development work is done
/build contains all the js files the typescript compiler produces and where the program is actually running from. Not intended to be readable
/doc is self explanatory

Use 'npm install' to download all necessary dependencies. package.json has some helpful scripts included, mainly 'npm run go' to compile the source code then execute it.
